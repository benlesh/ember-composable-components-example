Ember-composable-components-example
======================

# Use the branches

The various steps in the process of creating these components are captured in different branches in this repository.

# This is just an example

This is a quick and dirty example based on other soon to be open sourced work, which at some point in the near future should be found here: http://github.com/netflix/ember-cli-ember-dvc

The components this is based off of are much more feature rich and intended for reuse, where this is more intended as a demonstration or playground. You're free to use this code, but use it at your own risk.
